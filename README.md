# Amatics Technologies ltd Website

# Description

### Project origin
Amatics Technologies Website is a frontend project which i performed as one of the task given by my industrial supervisor at my Industrial Practical Training serving time at Amatics Technologies Company ltd.

### What it can do
In this project a user can navigate through different pages in the Amatics website and view many different services that are provided by the Amatics Technologies company,
Also within those navigated pages there is alot of styled elements using Bootstrap as a CSS library, Also within the pages there are some of contact links where by a user 
can contact directly the company for obtainance of information or assistance according to his/her requirements. The pages present are home, software, web services, Bulk SMS, 
Branding, IT services and Training.

### Technology used
In this project i used HTML, Bootstrap CSS for styling html elements and Javascript DOM in listening user events when performing different actions on html elements. I used Bootstrap for styling
HTML elements as because its easy to implement when styling html elements than using normal CSS. Also is used Javascript DOM in listening user events in order to improve 
user interactions and user experiences when navigating the website pages.

### Challenges and future features adding
One of the challenges i faced when performing this project was getting many html elements with the same class name via javascript DOM inorder to add event listener on them at once. This
made me use ID's inorder to target html elements and this made me writing alot of repeatedly lines of codes in my project.

One of the new feature i will add in this project is using class names instead of ID's for targeting HTML elements inorder to add event listeners to them. THis will help
in reducing number of repeatedly lines of codes.
